### Aim of the experiment

&nbsp;

•   To understand basics of Repetitive DNA sequences and its importance in genetics and molecular biology.



&nbsp;

•	To identify and calculate the number of repetitive DNA sequence in a DNA strand.

&nbsp;

•	To study restriction endonucleases, its cleavage sites and identifying how restriction endonucleases cleaves the DNA strands at recognition sites to form cohesive ends.
